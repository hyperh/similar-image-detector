# Similar Image Detector

A tool to help you find similar images within a folder of images.

Uses a convolutional autoencoder to encode images into a compressed representation.

## Training

1. `activate pytorch`
2. `python train_script`


## Outputting results

1. Point `get_similar_images_script.py` to correct folder
1. `python get_similar_images_script.py`
